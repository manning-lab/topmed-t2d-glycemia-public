# Single Variant Association -- Linear Mixed Models 

## Description 

This workflow performs a single variant association analysis of genotype data with a single phenotype using linear mixed models with fixed effects. The primary code is written in R using the GENESIS package for model fitting and association testing. The workflow can either generate a null model from phenotype and relatedness data or use a pregenerated null model.

## Main Functions

### fitNull

This function generates a null model to be used in association testing in Genesis

Inputs:
* genotype_files : genotype data for all samples (array of VCF or GDS file)
* phenotype_file : phenotype data for all samples to be included in analysis (CSV or TSV file)
* outcome : the outcome to be tested (string)
* outcome_type : the type of outcome being tested (dichotomous or continuous)
* covariates_string : covariates to condition on in linear mixed modeling (comma separated string, default = '')
* conditional_string : comma separated list of chromosome:position in the format: "chr1:100023,chr10:235225" for conditional analysis (string, optional)
* ivars_string : comma separated list of interaction variables (string, optional)
* sample_file : a file containing a list of sample ids (matching the genotype and phenotype files) to be included, one per line (.txt, optional)
* label : prefix for output filename (string)
* kinship_file : relatedness measures for all samples (CSV or TSV file)
* id_col : column name of id column in phenotype file (string)

Outputs:
* model : generated null model (.RDa)

### assocTest

This function performs an association test to generate p-values for each variant included.

Inputs:
* gds_file : a genotype file containing data for all samples are variants to be tested (.gds)
* null_file : output of the function *fitNull* or a pregenerated null model (.RDa)
* label : prefix for output filename (string)
* test : statistical test (Score or Wald, default = Score)
* mac : minimum minor allele count for variants to be included in analysis (int, default = 5)

Outputs:
* assoc : an RData file of associations results (.RData)

### summary

Generate a summary of association results including quantile-quantile and manhattan plots for variants subseted by minor allele frequency (all variants, maf < 5%, maf >= 5%). Also generates CSV files of all and the top associated variants.

Inputs:
* pval : the p-value column in the output of assocTest, this should be the statistical test with ".pval" appended (string, Score -> Score.pval, Wald -> Wald.pval)
* pval_threshold : p-value threshold for the returning top associations, top association output will include only variants with a p-value less than the threshold (float, default = 0.0001)
* label : prefix for output filename (string)
* assoc : output of assocTest (Array[.RData])

## Other workflow inputs

* this_memory : amount of memory in GB for each execution of a task (int)
* this_disk : amount of disk space in GB to allot for each execution of a task (int)
